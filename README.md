# ha-ambilight-hue
#### ``` Work in Progress```

These Home Assistan component were created to enable support for the synchronisation of Ambilight and other EGB lights for older Philips Ambilight TVs manufactured before 2016.
Unfortunately, there is no longer any official support for this, as the official iOS and Android apps, called ["new ambilight+hue"](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tpvision.ambilightplushue2&hl=de&gl=US), are no longer supported by Philips. This component is therefore intended to create a kind of workaround for Home Assistant users.

The code is largely based on the ["Ambilight + Yeelight"](https://github.com/jomwells/ambilight-yeelight) components by @jomwells. Thanks again for the great inspiration.
